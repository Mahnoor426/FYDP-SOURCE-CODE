final Year Project "Development of AI driven Algorithm for Maximizing Rabi Crop Yields"

## AIMS AND OBJECTIVES
The primary objectives of our project are:
• Develop AI-driven algorithms to optimize Rabi crops yield.
• Determine ideal sowing conditions for certain Rabi crops such as wheat, corn,
canola, cotton, chickpea, kidney beans, etc.
• Identify key factors that affect crop yield such as soil conditions, temperature,
precipitation levels, etc.
• Develop a user-friendly mobile application that gives timely recommendations
to farmers or agricultural researchers based on localized conditions.
• Compare AI recommendations with conventional practices to analyze
improvements in crop yield and cultivation strategies.

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
Developed a mobile application named AgroOptimizer to assist farmers, agricultural institutes, large-scale agri-businesses, agricultural researchers, and government agencies in Pakistan. The application provides precise recommendations on when and which Rabi crops to sow for maximum yield, promoting sustainable and responsible farming practices. Additionally, it serves as an educational tool for students and farmers seeking training in modern farming techniques.

## AgroOptimizer - Our Application
AgroOptimizer is a user-friendly smartphone app that combines powerful machine
learning algorithms to help farmers accurately estimate crops and production. Because
it was created with usability in mind and features user-friendly UI/UX elements like
large buttons and clear instructions, this made it simple to be use by users with a
variety of technical backgrounds. We created a thorough class diagram activity
diagram sequence diagram and architecture diagram that illustrated the parts and how
they interacted in order to define the applications structure. The complete development
and cross-platform capabilities of the technological stack are demonstrated by the
combination of Visual Studio, Android Studio, Flask, Python and React Native. We’ve
created an application with 11 interesting and intuitive screens all aimed at helping
farmers maximize agricultural productivity and make well-informed decisions.
Unique features can be found on key screens like Contributors, About Rabi, Contact
Us, Services, Details, Results, Tips and Hacks and Welcome. These improve the
usability and interactivity of the entire website. Examples include dynamic flip cards
that offer fascinating insights and a seamless Go Back button.
